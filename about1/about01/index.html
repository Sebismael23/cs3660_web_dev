              <p>Welcome to my corner of the web, where my ideas take flight using AWS.
                  Did you know that the first website ever created is still online today? 
                  In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee launched it as a simple page explaining what the World 
                  Wide Web was all about. Much like that historic beginning, 
                  we're here to spark curiosity, share knowledge, and inspire action. 
                  Whether you're here to explore, create, connect, or grade this page since it's an
                  assignment for CS3660 web 2. 
                  this space is built for you because every great journey starts with a first click.</p>
